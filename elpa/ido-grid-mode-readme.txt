Display your ido prospects in a grid, e.g (artist's ascii
impression, see URL for some pictures):

Find file:~/
-> *this*      and-some       the
   that        more-things    end
   the-other   here

The grid works a bit like the zsh completion grid; you can move
around it with the arrow keys or tab/backtab, and it scrolls when
you get to an edge if not everything will fit.

Mostly customizable with (customize-group "ido-grid-mode"). You can
change the keys bound, grid max/min dimensions, layout order (rows
vs columns), and whether to appear immediately or after <tab>.

Some examples of ways it can be used are at the github URL; it is
easy to use advices to get different invocations for ido to display
differently on the screen.
