;;; Commentary:

;; This is a game inspired by The Typing Of The Dead on the Dreamcast.
;; That game itself is a parody of The House Of The Dead.  In the
;; latter, players use a light gun to shoot zombies and other undead.
;; In the former, players have to *type* the names of the undead in
;; order to shoot them.  The Typing Of Emacs is the parody of the
;; parody, since there are no undead (except possibly for the user
;; staring at Emacs).
;;
;; In order to play, choose any buffer and type M-x typing-of-emacs RET
;; to start the game.  Traditionally used files are the source code of
;; the package, the Emacs NEWS file, and words file.
;;
;; In order to install, put this file somewhere on your `load-path' and
;; add (autoload 'typing-of-emacs "The Typing Of Emacs, a game." t) to
;; your ~/.emacs file.
;;
;; Note that this package will create a highscore list for you.  The
;; name of the file is stored in `toe-highscore-file'.  Set it to nil if
;; you don't want yet another dot file to clutter your home directory.

;;; Thanks:

;; Hrvoje Niksic <hniksic@iskon.hr> for the cl stuff.  I've decided that
;; maybe CL isn't such a bad thing after all.  :)

 

;;; Code:

;; The CL stuff is required in order to speed up the parsing function
;; tremendously.  Hrvoje Niksic <hniksic@iskon.hr> says:
;;
;;   "Before applying this fix, GNU Emacs 20.5.1 takes 73 seconds to
;;   parse the `words' file on a very fast machine.  After applying it,
;;   it takes 3 seconds.  Under XEmacs, the improvement is even more
;;   dramatic -- from 92 seconds to 1.2 seconds.
;;
;;   (If you plan to time the results yourself, don't forget to compile
;;   the code -- it uses macros heavily, which make it cons in
;;   interpreted mode.)"
