Hello everyone,

I am using Emacs since 2015. Overtime the configuration file had grown
to be a large 1000 line file with keybindings I do not use anymore &
macros that were replaced by modern packages with newer features.

So, this got me thinking "let me clean it up!"; issue was- inertia. I
didn't wanted to clean packages one by one & fix the
startup. Eventually I decided to delete my .Emacs & make a new one.

I had an even better idea. Make it a video series & post it on
relevant forums. Thus I started creating the video series on:
"configuring Emacs from scratch".

In the following section, I will update my journey with the video &
description for the same. This will include:
- a small summery of the packages that I install
- a brief description of the settings I change
- reason for not including any specific package.

This is my effort to make the Emacs configured from scratch. 
Hope you like it.

* Video 1: (setting up init file & org file for literate programming)

In the first video, I start by deleting my previous .emacs.d
directory. Then I start by creating the init.el & settings.org
file. The init.el file contained the org-babel for elisp code blocks
used in settings.org file.

I liked the idea of /literate programming/. So org mode with the
org-babel tangle feature got me really exited. Thus this became the
first video on how to do so.

In the settings, I always enjoy the full screen Emacs editing with no
GUI mouse click options. Thus following settings are made:
- disable menu bar, tool bar, scroll bar, init splash screen
- enable global linum mode
- no auto save file

* Video 2: (IDO)

In the next video, continuing with the trend, IDO (interactive Do)
mode specific things are set.  It is a mode that does things
interactively. E.g. if I need to find a file, by default Emacs will
not show the files in the directory, it only shows after 2 tabs are
pressed. This is solved by IDO with a linear list of files or
directory separated by '|' character.

* Video 3: (melpa package repo, ido grid mode) 

In this section, I set up the melpa package repository for Emacs to
load the packages. Form the repository, I installed the package for
displaying the IDO find files with a grid mode, rather than the
default linear one.
